A typical machine learning workflow involves creating a small inventory manually to train a supervised model, which is further used to map landslides in the surrounding areas of interest. This saves a lot of time and effort, however, it is still not suitable for a fully automated rapid mapping scenario as human intervention is required for creating the initial training inventory.
 
This repository has a generalized deep-learning model which can be used to map landslides triggred by large earthquakes or extreme rainfall events. It can be used directly without training for a specific event / georgaphic location.

This study proposed a new strategy for training a deep learning model to map event landslides from medium resolution EO data.

The tile size in display is for representation purposes and does not scale to the actual base resolution used in training the CNN. (B) Steps involved in the data-augmentation of input images with their corresponding landslide mask._
